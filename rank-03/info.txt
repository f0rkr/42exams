file handling rules:
	- The lines must be read in order and therefore operations must be executed in the same order	
	- There must be one space between each variable in a line
Error types:
	- "Error: argument\n"
	- "Error: Operation file corrupted\n"

	Hint:
	If a point is defined as (Xa, Ya)
	And a rectangle with a top left corner (Xtl, Ytl) and a bottom right corner (Xbr, Ybr)
	If Xtl <= Xa <= Xbr and Ytl <= Ya <= Ybr then the point is in the rectangle
